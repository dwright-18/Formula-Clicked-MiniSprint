# Formula-Clicked-MiniSprint
A work place training program in which my team aided Formula One in their quest to identify and recruit top performers.

This would be my second time participating in an IBM Clicked MiniSprint. I am currently in a pivot from Solutions Engineering in the Manufacturing space in to  Data/Machine Learning role. With the experience that I have gained from this course I plan to implement along my journey into data!

The Formula 1 pyton file is where I completd the course to the best that I could and documented my code/thought process through out this MiniSprint.
